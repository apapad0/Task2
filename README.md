# Task2: Create an automated test for rest endpoints.

**!Attention!** This code don't run. It contains abstract tests. It can be considered an example.

**Instructions**

1. git clone https://github.com/msRob0t/Task2
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python main.py

I don't test the login/update_user features. I check the rest api response (status_code, headers, json). I developed 17 tests. If all succeed it prints 'SUCCESS', if not it prints the test(s) that failed.
